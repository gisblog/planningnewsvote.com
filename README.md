**PNV: 'Tis the Season - News Chatting on PlanningNewsVote.COM (2007)**

_More reasons to login and vote. A small gift from PlanningNewsVote (PNV)- browser-based group chatting with website visitors. And it supports smileys! We just think that it makes a lot of sense to allow our visitors, who share a common interest in planning/GIS, to network more freely. Blogging is passe, subscribe to our channel! So starting 2008, we will test this service across corporate and government firewalls for network compatibility issues. In our initial testings, we found no browser-related problems. Just remember to login. Also, anytime you leave the webpage, your chat session will be renewed. So what's your news? Hoping to see you @ http://www.PlanningNewsVote.com/. - planner@planningnewsvote.com_
